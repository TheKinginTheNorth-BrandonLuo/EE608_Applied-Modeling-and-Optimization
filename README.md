# EE608_Applied-Modeling-and-Optimization
EE608 final project
This project is a optimization of two machine learning models, logistic regression and support vector machine based on wisconsin breast cancer dataset. In this project, we performed logistic regression model with L1 and L2 term for optimization in order to make the model simple and less loss. In support vector machine model, we add lagrange multipliers to get the best hyperplane to split different samples.
As for the dataset, we can use the dataset "wisc_bc_ContinuousVar.csv" which downloaded from Wisconsin University. Also we can use "from sklearn.datasets import load_breast_cancer" command in python to get the default breast cancer in anaconda3.
All the programming are based on jupyter notebook.
